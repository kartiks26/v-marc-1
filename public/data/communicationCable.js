This translates to more happy customers, larger cable TV networks and more profits for the cable operators. The cables are with central conductor of copper clad aluminium (CCA) which offers less weight and hence can support longer span of cables. Also due to principle of skin effect, the copper cladding over the central aluminium conductor carries signal without any loss of signal quality."]
