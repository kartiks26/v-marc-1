                content: ["The most acceptable metals for wires & cables are copper and aluminium due to their higher conductivity & ductility. Copper has higher affinity for sulphur it corrodes in the atmosphere where sulphur fumes is present. In these conditions tinned copper should be used as it forms a protective film over it & prevents it from tarnishing. Aluminium oxide film present on the surface of aluminium conductor acts as a barrier to protect it from corrosion. CONDUCTOR CONSTRUCTION The most economical construction for conductor is solid conductor i.e. conductor made of one single wire. As the area of conductor increases, solid conductor becomes stiffer and difficult to handle, therefore stranded construction is adopted. Here the conductor is made of number of strands. The strands are arranged in spiral layers in 1+6+12+18+…… formations. This geometrical progression of strands provides more compactness & flexibility. The stranded construction of conductors is more suitable for crimping of lugs. To economize the weight of insulating material, to optimize overall diameter, conductors are shaped & compacted in higher sized cables. The stranded conductor is shaped in to a segment of a circle so that when all the cores are laid, they form a complete circle. These segments are identified as 2 Core- 180 degrees, 3 Core- 120 degrees, 4 Core- 90 degrees, 3.5 Core- 100/60 degrees. IS 1554 permits solid conductor construction up to 10 sqmm in aluminium and up to 6 sqmm in copper. It permits the use of shaped conductors for size from 16 sqmm onwards."]

Above this the armouring is either with round wire or strip of size 4mm x 0.80mm. In long run of cables and in case of mines, round wire armouring is a must, as strip construction provide higher resistance to earth fault current and sometimes this current may not be sufficient to operate the circuit breaker in case of earth fault. In mines, the resistance of the armour in no case should exceed the resistance of the main core by more than 33% for safety reasons. To achieve this, sometimes tinned hard drawn copper wires are used along with galvanized steel wires. Sometimes two layers of round steel wire or steel strip are provided in opposite direction with barrier tape in between to provide extra protection. In case of single core cable for use in AC circuits, the material for armouring has to be non magnetic, as in this case the return current is not passing through the same cable and hence it will not cancel the magnetic field produced by the current. These magnetic lines which are oscillating in case of AC current will give rise to eddy current in magnetic armouring and hence armouring will become hot and this may lead to the failure of the cable. Generally hard drawn aluminium wires / strip are used for armouring in this case."
